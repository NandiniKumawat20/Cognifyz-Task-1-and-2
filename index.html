    <h1>Web Development Guide</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves creating both the frontend (user interface) and backend (server-side logic) that power the web. Web developers use various programming languages and frameworks to create interactive and functional digital experiences for users.</p>

    <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
    <p>Frontend development focuses on the user-facing side of websites. Developers use HTML to structure content, CSS to style and layout pages, and JavaScript to add interactivity. Popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular help build complex, responsive user interfaces. Frontend developers ensure websites are visually appealing, responsive across devices, and provide excellent user experiences.</p>
    
    <h2>Backend Development</h2>
    <p>Backend development handles the server-side logic that powers websites. Backend developers work with databases, APIs, and server frameworks using languages like Python, Node.js, Java, and PHP. They manage data storage, user authentication, business logic, and ensure the application scales effectively to handle traffic.</p>
    
    <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
    <p>Full Stack developers have expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, allowing them to build complete web applications from start to finish. This versatility makes them valuable in startups and small teams where wearing multiple hats is essential.</p>
